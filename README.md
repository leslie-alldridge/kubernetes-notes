## Kubernetes

Kubernetes coordinates a highly available cluster of computers that are connected to work as a single unit. 

The master coordinates the cluster and the nodes are workers that run applications.

Each node has a Kubelet agent which manages the node and communicates with the master.

Minimum 3 nodes in a cluster for production level applications.
